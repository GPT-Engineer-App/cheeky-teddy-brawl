**Description**: ## Detailed Prompt for "Terrible Teddies" Card Battling Game

### Concept Overview
"Terrible Teddies" is a 2-player card battling game for Android that combines strategic gameplay with naughty, adult, tongue-in-cheek humor. Players will control mischievous teddy bears, each with unique abilities and personalities, aiming to humiliate and defeat their opponent's teddies. The game will feature hyper-detailed, hyper-realistic graphics and a variety of humorous, adult-oriented scenarios and card effects.

### Game Mechanics

#### **Objective**
- The primary objective is to reduce your opponent's HP (Health Points) to zero by playing various Action, Trap, and Special cards.

#### **Game Setup**
- Each player starts with a deck of 40 cards, shuffled thoroughly.
- Players draw an initial hand of 6 cards.
- A coin flip or similar method determines who goes first.

#### **Turn Structure**
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw one card from your deck.
2. **Main Phase**: Play Action, Trap, and Special cards. Players can:
   - Attack with Action cards to reduce the opponent's HP.
   - Defend with Trap cards to block or mitigate damage.
   - Use Special cards for unique effects (e.g., healing, drawing extra cards, etc.).
3. **End Phase**: Conclude your turn, allowing the opponent to start their turn.

#### **Card Types**
- **Action Cards**: Used to attack the opponent. Each action card has an attack value and sometimes a humorous effect (e.g., "Pillow Fight" - deals 3 damage and makes the opponent discard a card).
- **Trap Cards**: Used to defend against attacks or set up future plays (e.g., "Bear Trap" - negates an attack and deals 2 damage back).
- **Special Cards**: Provide unique benefits or effects (e.g., "Stuffing Surge" - heal 5 HP, "Honey Jar" - draw 2 additional cards).

#### **Resource System**
- **Momentum Gauge**: Players spend Momentum points to play cards. The gauge starts at 0 and moves towards the opponent's side as points are spent. When the gauge reaches the opponent's side, the turn ends.
- **Energy Points**: Each card has an energy cost that must be paid using Momentum points.

### Art and Design

#### **Visual Style**
- Hyper-detailed, hyper-realistic teddy bears with exaggerated, humorous expressions and poses.
- Backgrounds and environments that reflect the naughty, adult humor theme (e.g., a messy bedroom, a chaotic living room).

#### **Character Design**
- **Naughty Teddies**: Each teddy bear should have a distinct personality and design, reflecting their mischievous nature.
  - *Example*: "Teddy the Troublemaker" - A teddy with a sly grin, holding a whoopee cushion.
  - *Example*: "Sassy Sally" - A teddy with a cheeky wink, holding a feather duster.

#### **Card Art**
- **Action Cards**: Illustrations depicting the teddies in action, performing humorous and naughty attacks.
- **Trap Cards**: Illustrations showing traps being set or activated, often with a comedic twist.
- **Special Cards**: Creative and funny depictions of special abilities or effects.

### Humor and Tone

#### **Dialogue and Flavor Text**
- Incorporate adult, tongue-in-cheek humor in the card descriptions and dialogue.
  - *Example*: "Pillow Fight" - "Soft, fluffy, and surprisingly painful!"
  - *Example*: "Bear Trap" - "Caught you by the stuffing!"

#### **In-Game Events**
- Include humorous in-game events and animations when certain cards are played.
  - *Example*: When "Pillow Fight" is played, an animation of teddies throwing pillows at each other with feathers flying everywhere.

### User Interface

#### **Main Menu**
- Playful and engaging menu design with animated teddies.
- Options for Single Player, Multiplayer, Deck Builder, and Settings.

#### **In-Game HUD**
- Clear display of HP, Momentum Gauge, and cards in hand.
- Fun and intuitive animations for drawing cards, attacking, and activating traps.

### Multiplayer Features

#### **Matchmaking**
- Quick and easy matchmaking for 2-player battles.
- Option to play with friends via invite or random opponents.

#### **Leaderboards and Achievements**
- Track player progress and achievements.
- Include humorous titles and badges (e.g., "Master of Mischief", "Stuffing Slayer").

### Monetization

#### **In-App Purchases**
- Offer cosmetic upgrades for teddies and card backs.
- Optional card packs with new and exclusive cards.

#### **Ads**
- Optional ad viewing for in-game rewards (e.g., extra Momentum points, card packs).

### Summary
"Terrible Teddies" aims to provide a unique and entertaining card battling experience with a blend of strategic gameplay and adult humor. The detailed and realistic art style, combined with the mischievous nature of the teddies, will create a memorable and engaging game for adult players.
